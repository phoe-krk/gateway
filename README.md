# Gateway
RP and chat server/client written in Common Lisp

**Dependencies:** `SECURE-READ` library, found in a neighboring repository.

Don't mind the /old/ folder, that's stuff that is being refactored into proper project structure.

To run tests, load the project with ASDF/Quicklisp and `(gateway::run)`.
