# Gateway

Gateway is a service for cooperative storytelling / textual roleplaying.

Gateway is currently in very early alpha is not yet anyhow usable.

## Why is Gateway licensed under AGPL?

I am aware that this license prevents some people from using or contributing to this piece of software, which is a shame. But unfortunately the majority of software developers have not yet understood that

  1. In a digital world, free software is a necessary prerequisite for a free society.
  2. When developing software, open collaboration is way more efficient than competition.

So as long as distribution of non-free software is socially accepted, copyleft licenses like the AGPL seem to be the lesser evil.

That being said, I am willing to discuss relicensing on an individual basis.
